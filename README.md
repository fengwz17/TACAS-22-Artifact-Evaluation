# TACAS-22-Artifact-Evaluation

This is the pre-acceptance artifact for the research paper "Efficient Translation From Limit Deterministic Büchi Automata to Deterministic ω-Automata", submitted to TACAS'22.
Due to its size, the zip file of the artifact can be found as a [release](https://github.com/fengwz17/TACAS-22-Artifact-Evaluation/releases/tag/v1.1); [click here](https://github.com/fengwz17/TACAS-22-Artifact-Evaluation/releases/download/v1.1/artifact.zip) for direct access.

In this artifact, we provide the source code for [COLA](https://github.com/fengwz17/COLA), the tool implementing the determinization algorithm presented in the paper, and the executables for the tools [SPOT](https://spot.lrde.epita.fr/) and [OWL](https://owl.model.in.tum.de/) we compare with.
The execution of the tools on the benchmark files is managed by [benchexec](https://github.com/sosy-lab/benchexec/); thus the artifact contains all files needed to execute the benchmarks, together with scripts and TeX files used to generate the plots presented in the paper, either in the main part or in the appendix.

The artifact can be downloaded and used by respecting the content of License.txt, as stored in the [artifact.zip](https://github.com/fengwz17/TACAS-22-Artifact-Evaluation/releases/download/v1.1/artifact.zip) file.
