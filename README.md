# TACAS-22-Artifact-Evaluation

This is the pre-acceptance artifact for the research paper "Efficient Translation From Limit Deterministic Büchi Automata to Deterministic ω-Automata".

In this artifact, we provide the source code for COLA, the tool implementing the determinization algorithm presented in the paper, and the executables for the tools SPOT and OWL we compare with.
The execution of the tools on the benchmark files is managed by benchexec; thus the artifact contains all files needed to execute the benchmarks, together with scripts and TeX files used to generate the plots presented in the paper, either in the main part or in the appendix.
